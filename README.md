These tutorials walk through various packages that can assist with omics data processing for bioinformaticians


SCRIPT ONE. HOW TO OBTAIN MULTIPLE PROTEOMES OFF NCBI.ORG USING NCBI_DATASETS
The first script titled "ObtainingProteomesViaCommandLine" will walk you through how to download a single proteome or loop through obtaining thousands of proteomes through the command-line for reference organisms off NCBI.org
The input for this search to be performed can be common name, taxonomic name (family, genus, species), accession, or NCBI taxonomic ids in the form of a text file. It performs the same function as searching directly via the search bar on NCBI.org. It utilized the conda package ncbi_datasets which can be obtained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v1/quickstarts/command-line-tools/ . You can obtain all the proteomes or just the reference. You can also download genomic datasets. Follow their tutorial for more information related to genomics.
