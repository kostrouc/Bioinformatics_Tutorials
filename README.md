**SCRIPT ONE. HOW TO OBTAIN MULTIPLE PROTEOMES OFF NCBI.ORG & UNIPROT.ORG**

The first script titled "ObtainingProteomesViaCommandLine" walks through how to download a single proteome or loop through obtaining thousands of proteomes via the command-line for organisms off NCBI.org and Uniprot.org.
The input for this search to be performed can be common name, taxonomic name (family, genus, species), accession, or NCBI taxonomic ids in the form of a text file. It performs the same function as searching directly via the search bar on NCBI.org and UniProt.org. For downloading off NCBI.org the conda package ncbi_datasets is used, which can be obtained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v1/quickstarts/command-line-tools/ . All proteomes can be obtained or just the references. Genomic datasets can also be downloaded. Follow their tutorials for more information related to genomics.
